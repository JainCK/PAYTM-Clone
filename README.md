# MERN Paytm-like App

Welcome to the MERN Paytm-like App! This application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, incorporating features like user authentication, a dashboard, user search, money transfers, and balance tracking. It is designed to be dynamic, responsive, and utilizes technologies like JWT for authentication, react-router-dom for navigation, recoil for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.
  
- **Express:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
  
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

- **react-router-dom:** A routing library for React applications.

- **recoil:** A state management library for React applications.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for building modern designs.
